    <string name="kosova_description">Kosova is probably among the youngest countries of the world as it received its independence
        the twenty first century only, in the year 2008, to be precise. Since there wasn’t much development,
        half the country is under poverty line.
        The country’s major natural resources remain untapped and hence the economy of the country is primarily agrarian.
        Having said all that, Kosovo has been bestowed by nature with variety of gifts in the form of a picturesque setting.
        These landscapes are covered with unending lush greens and in these wilds, reside a number of animal species which are native
        and a few of rare ones too. This developing country, although does not recesive much tourist attention because of its political situation,
        has got great potential to develop into a major tourist hotspot.</string>
